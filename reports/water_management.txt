Small-Scale Irrigation and Water Harvesting in Sub-Saharan Africa

Rainfall variability in the Sahel and East Africa leads to frequent dry spells. Simple water
harvesting techniques—such as zai pits, contour bunds and stone lines—can increase infiltration
by up to 50%. Farmer-managed small reservoirs (100–500 m³) paired with drip irrigation boost
water-use efficiency to >80%. Integrating soil moisture sensors and SMS alerts allows precise
scheduling of irrigation, reducing water use by 25% and increasing yields by 15–20% in tomato and
maize trials.
