Soil Organic Matter and Nutrient Cycling in East Africa

Healthy soils in East Africa typically have 2–5% organic matter, which improves water retention,
provides slow-release nutrients and supports microbial biodiversity. Common constraints include
nitrogen and phosphorus depletion, which can be remediated through integrated nutrient management:
combining mineral fertilizers with compost and legume rotation. Cover cropping with species like
Mucuna pruriens reduces erosion, increases soil cover and boosts nitrogen fixation by 20–30%.
Regular pH testing (target 6.0–7.0) and micronutrient assays (Zn, B) are critical for high-value
vegetable and fruit production.
