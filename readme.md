# RAG Chatbot for Farmers

> An AI-driven, retrieval-augmented chatbot that taps into reports on soil health and water management to answer farmers‚Äô questions in real time.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Report Generation**  
  - Run `create_reports.py` to generate `.txt` reports (e.g. `soil_health_ea.txt`, `water_management.txt`) 
- **TF-IDF Prototype**  
  - Quick demo in `main.py` using Scikit-learn TF-IDF + KNN for passage retrieval.
- **Production-Ready Pipeline**  
  - `improved.py` leverages SentenceTransformers embeddings + FAISS for fast, semantic retrieval over large document sets.
- **Chunking Strategy**  
  - Automatically splits long reports into overlapping 500-token chunks for context-rich prompts.
- **Plug-and-Play LLM Support**  
  - Easily swap in your model of choice (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.) by adjusting a single config line.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Clone & Activate Environment**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/David-Okello/RAG-Farmer-Chatbot
   cd RAG-Farmer-Chatbot
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # (or .\.venv\Scripts\Activate on Windows)
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
    - pip install --upgrade pip
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

## üí° Usage

1. Generate Reports
    ```bash
    python create_reports.py
    ```
    Creates reports/soil_health_ea.txt and reports/water_management.txt.

2. Run TF-IDF Prototype
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    Answers a sample soil-health query using the TF-IDF + KNN approach.

3. Run Production RAG
    ```bash
    python improved.py \
    --docs_folder reports \
    --model_name all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \
    --top_k 5
    ```
    Splits each report into chunks

    Builds/loads a FAISS index

    Retrieves top-K relevant chunks

    Sends consolidated prompt to your chosen LLM

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design
- Chunking: Overlap of 100 tokens to preserve context boundaries.

- Embedding: Dense vector generation via SentenceTransformers.

- Indexing: FAISS index for sub-millisecond semantic search.

- Prompting: Dynamically concatenates retrieved chunks before LLM call.

### improved.py
An improved version of the RAG prototype.
Think of main.py as RAG version 1 and improved.py as RAG version 1.1

SentenceTransformer gives you dense semantic embeddings (vs. TF-IDF‚Äôs keyword overlap).
FAISS is the industry standard for fast, approximate nearest-neighbor retrieval at scale.

a) Document Loading & Chunking
- Why chunk? LLMs have context-window limits (they get dumbüòÖ). Breaking large reports into overlapping 500-token snippets preserves continuity at boundaries.

- Metadata (e.g. source=file.name) lets you filter by region, date, or document type at retrieval time.

b) Embedding & Indexing
- ‚Äúall-MiniLM-L6-v2‚Äù balances speed vs. semantic power.

- L2 normalization + Inner-Product is mathematically equivalent to cosine similarity, which works well for nearest-neighbor retrieval.

- IndexFlatIP is the simplest FAISS index; for millions of docs you‚Äôd swap in an IVF or HNSW variant.

c) Retrieval + Prompt Composition
1. Embed the user query into the same semantic space.

2. Search the FAISS index for the top-k closest chunks.

3. Optional metadata filtering ensures, for example, only ‚ÄúEast Africa‚Äù docs are returned.

4. Build a system‚Äâ+‚Äâcontext prompt:

    - A clear ‚ÄúYou are ‚Ä¶‚Äù system instruction locks the chatbot‚Äôs persona.

    - Numbered contexts let you‚Äîand the LLM‚Äîtrace back which passages informed the answer.

    - Appending User: ‚Ä¶ Bot: sets the stage for an LLM call (e.g. openai.ChatCompletion.create(prompt=prompt)).

High-Level Takeaways
1. Modularity: each function has a single responsibility (chunking, embedding, indexing, retrieval, prompting).

2. Scalability path:

    - Swap TF-IDF ‚Üí dense embeddings for better semantic recall.

    - Scale FAISS ‚Üí distributed IVF/HNSW for millions of docs.

    - Add caching of embeddings & prompts for low-latency.

3. Explainability: humans can inspect ‚Äúwhich snippet #2 came from file X‚Äù to audit and debias the system.

4. Security: RAG prototypes should run over sanitized, internally hosted document stores behind VPCs to avoid exposing sensitive reports.

### main.py
Sample RAG prototype: vectorize simple soil-health docs, retrieve top-3, build prompt.

1. Sample ‚Äúsoil-health‚Äù documents (simulating indexed World Bank reports)
2. Build TF-IDF embeddings & NearestNeighbors index
3. Embed query
4. Retrieve top-3 docs
5. Compose prompt
6. Show results
